# JS30-code
My code for the JavaScript 30 course. The purpose of this project is to document my growth whilst learning about JavaScript.

## Drum-Kit
In order to test my current ability in JS, I first decided to make an attempt on this mini project without looking at the tutorial.
The result was funny to look at once I had seen the actual code written by the JS30 course owner. In a small amount of time, I have
discovered much more efficient ways to write JS code.

Now that I understand the purpose of data-* attributes, I have removed unnecessary id tags. I also have a better understanding of event listeners – I had previously used the onfocus attribute in the body element because I had assumed that it was necessary to “indicate” the action by doing so.

Discovered querySelector, and Jquery. They made code much more efficient, removing the need for “for loops” and “if statements”.
I learn about shorthand if statements.
