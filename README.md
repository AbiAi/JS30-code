# JS30-code
My code for the JavaScript 30 course. The purpose of this project is to document my growth whilst learning about JavaScript.

## Drum-Kit
In order to test my current ability in JS, I first decided to make an attempt on this mini project without looking at the tutorial.
The result was funny to look at once I had seen the actual code written by the JS30 course owner. In a small amount of time, I have
discovered much more efficient ways to write JS code.
